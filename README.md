About this application
----------------------

Enzyme is a handy and reliable application designed to enable you to control your computer the way you like the most. Change monitor brightness, system volume, window transparency, and many more features with a mouse gesture, a joystick, a keyboard or even speech. 

Actions are customizable and conditional groups are supported, so that a certain mouse movement may play/pause a song on media players but refresh an internet page on browsers.
