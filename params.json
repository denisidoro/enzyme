Change monitor brightness, system volume, window transparency, and many more features with a mouse gesture, a joystick, a keyboard or even speech. \r\n\r\nActions are customizable and conditional groups are supported, so that a certain mouse movement may play/pause a song on media players but refresh an internet page on browsers.\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPlease note I haven't written this code in its entirety.
